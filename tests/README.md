We can use this place to do all the unit testing for our code.

Feel free to add your unit tests to the tests folder.

We can also use this to keep track of functions that are not working as intended

Currently we can do the following:

'make' : compiles all the code

'make clean' : removes object files

./test_Government : runs the doctest for Government (Marco)

./test_Citizen : runs the doctest for Citizen (Saber)

./test_BuildingFactory : runs the doctest for the creation of Buildings (Chisom/Capleton)

./test_BuildingComponents : runs the doctest for Building Components (Chisom/Capleton)
