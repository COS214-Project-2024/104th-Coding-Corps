Welcome to the 104th-Coding-Corp's City Builder project!

Our project implements a functional version of a City Builder simulation using various design patterns that we have explored throughout COS214. The simulation gives the user the ability to make decisions that affect how the growth of a city occurs. The user can run the simulation and let the events of everyday life play out and observe their citizens satisfaction. But be warned... Do not let your citizens get too dissatisfied otherwise your city will suffer the consequences!

The game files are contained in the 'System' directory. If you would like to check out the game, change your directory to 'System' and then type in 'make' into your terminal. Then you can 'make run' to run the game.

The Unit Testing is contained in a directory called 'UnitTests'. If you would like to see the unit tests, go into the directory and compile with 'make' as a result, you will be able to run each of the unit tests separately by typing in './test_Name' where 'Name' is the name of the relavant unit test file.

The 'Report' directory contains the functional requirements, an overview of the system and all patterns used as well as a link to our git repo.

The 'Diagrams' directory contains all of the diagrams used in making our project.
